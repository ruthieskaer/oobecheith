                            <p> Men on the small dick sub seem convinced that most women would walk out on a guy once they’ve realised he has a small dick. I can’t see that being true - maybe if the girl is total asshole but surely most normal women wouldn’t- right? I mean if you met a guy, he looked good and you liked him, you went back to his place to fuck, you start kissing etc then he pulls down his pants and you realise he’s only 4 inches (hard) would you just laugh, pull your clothes back on and leave? Surely Is that terrible? I have been looking for a FWB after getting out of a 2 year relationship, and I’m realizing my hookups are a lot smaller than I’m used to. Ex was no giant but above average and very hard. New hookups have been softer and small and quick to finish. I’m happy to deal with this with someone I’m into emotionally, but I’m not doing an emotional relationship right now, I just want to be satisfied, size-wise. Any tips on what to say? It can be hard for a woman to feel confident. 
Hello guys, it's my first post here. Back in January I stepped up in the adult life and my Girlfriend for my birthday suggested sex as a part of her present for me. We are now 4 years together and we never did any sexual stuff other than kissing. I never thought 'bout my penis as big neither small. But it was a real problem right there. I couldn't make her feel good. I felt bad, I was so ashamed I didn't speak to her for two weeks. The foreplay I think was good even though I didn't. My boyfriend and I have recently started experimenting sexually and he’s incredibly self conscious about his penis size. It’s about 3 inches in length and we’ve not been able to achieve any sort of penetration whatsoever. Does anyone have any advice besides “I hope he’s good at oral” because the question at hand is how to achieve penetration, not an orgasm. Thank you in advance. Ok, so my girlfriend is the first person I have ever been sexually involved with, and as great as it really is, we've had some struggles. The thing is, as much as it pains me to say it, I feel like my penis is a bit on the small side. I believe it is around 4.5 inches. Combine that with the fact that my girlfriend is severely unflexible, and we have problems. I have such a hard time getting past her legs. It's just so incredibly difficult for me to get any kind of penetration with me being. 
2nd time asking a question here hope it's not a super obvious one. I've been hooking up w this girl a couple times now and I'm a bit on the larger side and shes on the smaller side and basically the only positions that don't hurt her are her on top but laying down (i.e. her chest to mine) or missionary but I'm only going like half of the way in. I think its good for her but its definitely not good for me, only being able to thrust like half the length of my dick is really annoying and I haven't. This situation concerns me a little bit. First of all my sex drive has been through the roof and I've had a bunch of weird fetishes I never thought I'd have develop (another story for another time). My bf is overweight and very limited when it comes to sex positions and it's dangerous for him to push himself. I knew he was insecure so I would refrain from initiating sex and I would masterbate while he was out or in the shower. But one time I decided I wanted another body and tried The additional problem is that he really likes queefs in porn and what is ironic that several hung ex boyfriends that I had could give it to me but I was terribly embarrassed of it because of both funny noises and how I couldn't control myself in the slightest. How fucking ironic. I don't mind lying to him but I am so bored with doing it so much often!! It feels creepy. Just out of curiosity I was browsing Netflix and stumbled on a documentary about the male penis size. The documentary is called Unhung Hero, I'm sure some of you have seen the video. Anyone who is questioning themselves should really give it a good look. And for those too lazy, if it's one thing I took away from this video its: "Man, if I had your penis size I would." "What, what you would do? It would still be you plus a few extra inches, but guess what, you're still you. And people. Let me start out by saying that this is my first post here ever so if I mess up, please forgive me. Also it's almost 3 am so I hope this is coherent. My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together for 8 months now and sex with him has been consistently. anti-climatic. He has the smallest penis I have ever seen (less than 4 inches) and he is very self conscious about it. The first time we ever had sex he cried because he said he thought I was disappointed which, to be honest I was. I hardly. There is a big problem in Skyrim that I feel isn't really talked about. One of the biggest downgrades from Oblivion to Skyrim is the amount of houses in all of the cities. Note: that i'm not speaking of player homes. When you compare the imperial city and solitude, the difference is just massive. The amount of shoppes and houses is just perfect in the imperial city. It is not only the imperial city, that is bigger. The rest of the cities is also bigger in Oblivion than its counterpart in Skyrim. Quick background: My son is 15 months old. He loves balls. They're his favorite thing. A few weeks ago, we were walking around the toy aisle because occasionally I like to spoil him and he saw a display of kick balls and got really excited. They were about  so I let him out of the cart to choose one. He loves that ball. First thing he grabs every morning. He'll carry it around the house hugging it. He might be weird, but he is my kid. Never had a chance at being normal. Me: some random perso.
